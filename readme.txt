== Description ==

TheyWorkForYou lets you find out what your MP, MSP or MLA is doing in your name, read debates, written answers, see what’s coming up in Parliament, and sign up for email alerts when there’s past or future activity on someone or something you’re interested in.

This plugin adds a widget to your WordPress site that allows you to show the recent activity of an MP.

Important: The original version of this plugin, built in December 2009 is far too old and should be removed completely before installing this plugin.
